# Help Wanted Documentation

The Help Wanted section can be optional, but it is highly encouraged. The core team can point to what features they would like to see as well as the skill set needed and difficulty level. Having a strong Help Wanted document empowers our engineers to determine where they can give back to the project.

This document can also link to a forum where requests and offers are posted as well as contain a list of requests.
