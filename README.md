# Metrostop

An interactive graph for an end-to-end view. A metrostop is a visual representation of a product's lifecycle which can be used for the maintenance, optimization, analysis and conception of a product's life cycle processes.

## What is a Metrostop View?

The Metrostop application is a graphical interface used to map the steps of an end-to-end process from beginning to end.
